## Description
- The motivation for this project is to ensure that the codebase of a marketing agency website follows  accessibility standards.it's crucial for websites to be accessible to all users in today's digital age. By following accessibility standards, not only will the agency's website be more inclusive, but it will also be more easily discoverable by search engines. 
- This project addresses the problem of websites not being fully accessible to users with disabilities, which can negatively impact both the user experience and the website's search engine optimization. By refactoring the codebase to meet accessibility standards, the website will be more inclusive and optimized for search engines.

- This project is  not only addresses the important issue of website accessibility, but it also specifically focuses on the impact that accessibility can have on search engine optimization.
